## Projects

### Project 1: National Risk Index
  
In this project, I analyzed the National Risk Index (NRI) for natural disasters, performing a sensitivity analysis to assess potential biases in FEMA’s scoring methodology. By cleaning and combining datasets from the NRI and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), I developed an alternative risk scoring model and compared it to the NRI’s method. This process involved handling missing data, creating summary tables and visuals, and identifying differences in risk levels for the state of Colorado and Montana. Ultimately, I proposed improvements to the NRI methodology, helping to ensure a more accurate and unbiased representation of risk for communities

### Project 2: Automation of Concrete Mix Design Using Python for the Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT)

For this project with the Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT) data, I automated the concrete mix design process, which had previously been done manually in Excel. Using Python, I created functions to replicate the calculations in the “Mix Design” sheet, allowing for the input of various material properties and generating the required weight of each component for one cubic yard of concrete. I ran four different concrete mix scenarios and generated two graphs to visually compare the differences between the mixes, highlighting the variation in material weights and key components for each scenario.
